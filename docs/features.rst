Hang-Down is an addon for Blender software that allows for easy and fast creation of ropes/hoses/wires and chains.

Whether you need to animate a dog on leash, create some cables that hang down realistically or simulate an anchor chain, it all can be done with this addon.
It has friendly UI and is packed with many features:
#. create and edit physically based ropes/cables/hoses and chains
#. use custom profile for ropes
#. use custom links for chains
#. create and edit force fields (wind, turbulence, etc)
#. edit multiple ropes/chains/force fields at once
#. setup material for ropes/chains
#. create cyclic (e.g. with shape of a circle) ropes/chains
#. transform curves to ropes/chains
#. scatter ropes/chains using particle systems
#. group ropes/chains (allows you to work faster when there are many objects)
